# Frontend template repo

A simple starter for frontend projects with basic setup and best practices.

## What's included

You can also use these as references for your own projects.

- `.nvmrc` file for using the latest Node.js LTS version
- `.npmrc` file to lock dependency versions for better security
- `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting

### Demos

Included are demo branches you can use or reference to help you setup specific tools. Included branches:

| Branch name | Description |
-- | ---
`feature/ci-example` | CI workflows with linting, formatting, and a11y checks.
`feature/vite-uswds` | USWDS, Vite, and modern SASS api setup.


## How to use this template

When you create a new repo from this template, you get the same file structure and files without the git history. So you can start cleanly and focus on things specific to your project.

Learn more at [Creating a repository from a template [GitHub]](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

After creating your repo, update `package.json` with your project details.
